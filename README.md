# Numerical-Methods-and-Random-Processes

These are some of the implementation of algorithms in the course of Numerical Methods and Random Process.

1. Bisection Method:

C++ Based implementation of Bisection Algorithm to find roots of polynomials (approximation).
Assumptions: 
a) There is no complex root (/ there is at least one real root).

To contributors:
Comparison of two floating points need revision and editions. Improvement in range setting to find a and b, is also required ( s.t f(a) * f(b) < 0). 

Thanks!
Stay updated.
